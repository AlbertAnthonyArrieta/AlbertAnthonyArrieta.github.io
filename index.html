          I am a young aspiring developer located in Calgary, Alberta with about
          3 years of programming experience. I have recently graduated from
          Southern Alberta Institute of Technology(SAIT) as Software Development
          student and looking forward to use my skills and experiences in the
          near future. My current goal right now is to continue learning and
          discover new technologies that would help me better my skills as a
          developer.

              <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
              <p>When it comes to coding, I love working with the front-end the most. I enjoy exploring different front-end libraries and I love
                 to work with front-end frameworks such as Angular. In the future, I plan to learn more front-end technologies such as React and try to use them for future opportunities
                 or just integrate them into future projects of mine. </p>

              <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
              <p>I was exposed to Object-Oriented programming for the most part at SAIT where I got to build different applications with Java. I 
                learned how to use object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation.

              <h3>UI Design</h3>
              <p>Before I started to learn how to code, I was very passionate about design. I created vector graphics as a hobby when I was in highschool and also played around with 3D modeling softwares such as blender and autdodesk Inventor.
                When I started to learn how to program, I enjoyed designing graphical user interfaces that are eye-appealing by using CSS in web development or interface libraries such as Java

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
              A volunteer management system created for the non-profit organization Calgary Animal Rescue Society (CARS). The purpose of the system is to 
              allow CARS administrators to manage volunteer information, foster information, volunteer applications, foster applications, and manage events 
              that active volunteers could register for. This project originally started as my capstone group's project for SAIT and I with a few of the 
              others have decided to continue to work on the system for CARS after graduation. This project is still currently being worked on and you can 
              check out the progress with the links below.
            </p>
              

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <!-- <p>
              January was when we finally started to develop the system. My role during development was to work with the frontend team where we used Angular 
              and Bootstrap as frameworks to help us build the website. Bootstrap and Angular was never taught in our curriculum so the team had to learn 
              outside of school which was something we thought would be a good practice since in the industry, software developers would always have to learn 
              new concepts due to the rapid growth of technologies throughout the years. Learning Bootstrap and Angular by myself was really fun and I plan 
              to learn more technologies in my own time in the future. Now being halfway finished through our project, the backend team has created the 
              database using sql and we plan to connect it to the frontend by using SpringBoot. For the frontend, we are just finished creating form pages 
              and I am currently developing the base foundation pages (snippets included in this repository) for the frontend team to build on top of on.
            </p> -->
            <p>
              My role during this project was to work with the front-end along with 3 other group members. During the preparation stage, I lead in designing 
              the UI and the prototype interface design to base our project on. During development I had to learn Angular and Bootstrap on my own with some
              help using the internet and my peers. Most of my time during development was to develop service files that communicated with the backend that
              uses SpringBoot RESTful api and refining the user interface using Bootstrap. Design consistency 
              throughout the different pages in the web app was something I looked for and creating multiple forms for user input that would be communicating with the backend database 
              that used SpringBoot. REPHRASE THIS
            </p>
            <h4>What I've learned</h4>
            <p>
              This project was the first project where I was able to work with a team of developers. This project also consisted of learning new technologies
              that was never taught before in SAIT such as Angular, TypeScript and Bootstrap. This project forced me to learn independantly and taught me that 
              it is an essential skill as a developer to learn new technologies. This introduced me to many new concepts that I have never learnt before in my 
              past programming experience such as component-based development which is a big deal in angular. I also learned a lot of managerial concepts since
              I was able to work with 6 other students on this project. I’ve learned how a project development life cycle would look like and how work is 
              distributed to different teams and members within the group. I learnt that communication and planning is critical to the project because with a 
              big group, ideas will get thrown around everywhere and everyone must be on the same page with each other. People will have different opinions on 
              things, and it is important because the group itself will have to come to a consensus on how things will be developed.
